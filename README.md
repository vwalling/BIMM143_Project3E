# BIMM143_Project3E
For this project, you will need two files to run the code: 

1. The Project_3E.rmd file that contains the R script.
2. The isolated_genes.fasta file that contains the original gene 16 and isolates from pBAD and pSANG clones. 

All of these gene sequences were isolated from experiments that I performed in a lab. The gene constructs were amplified using PCR and grown in a vector system. They were then digested using the restriction enzymes NcoI and NotI and then ligated into the expression systems pBAD and pSANG. The expression vectors were isolated and sanger sequencing was performed. I pulled up the sequences using the .seq files and converted them to .fasta files using txt edit. I then isolated gene 16 from both expression vectors by searching for the restriction enzymes and creating a new txt file with these sequences. The fasta file that is attached are these sequences.
